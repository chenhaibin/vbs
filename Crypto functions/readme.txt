rijndaelvb.zip

The enclosed VB project includes a VB class that implements the Rijndael AES block encryption algorithm. The form in the project runs some test data through the class.

The rijndael.asp file is a VBScript ASP file that can be used as a server side include for encryption using the Rijndael AES block cipher algorithm. The rijndaeltest.asp shows how the encryption routine can be called by running some test data through the algorithm.
