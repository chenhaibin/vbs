Q. How can I restrict guest access to Event logs?

A. By default guests and anonymous can view the event log, this may give away important information and so anonymous/guest access can be disabled as follows:

Start the registry editor (regedit.exe) 
Move to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog 
Move to the subkey Application 
From the Edit menu select New - DWORD value. Enter a name of RestrictGuestAccess. click OK 
Double click the new value and set to 1 
Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the Security and System sub-keys also. 
In fact this is also governed by the registry rights on the corresponding eventlog paramters (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog - application and system). You can even remove Administrators rights to read the files by using the registry rights. Use REGEDT32.EXE to change these rights.
